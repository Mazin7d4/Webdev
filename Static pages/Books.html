                <p class="paragraph">In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes.

Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.</p>
